        <p>Deepwoken is a brutal, open-world roguelike RPG.</p>
        <p>It's well known for it's in depth mechanics, lore, and of course PvP.</p>
        <p>Deepwoken has a complex parry-based combat system, being based off your build.</p>

        <p>This may seem "bad" but it gives the player complete creativity and control over how they want to play the game.</p>
        <p>For example, if you're very confident in your parrying skills you could do a glass cannon build.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you feel your parrying skills are terrible you could do a tank build.</p>

        <p>Regardless of what you pick, most of your builds will end up the same. Wiped.</p>
        <p>Deepwoken has a brutal permadeath mechanic. If you die twice, you get sent to "The Depths".</p>
        <p>If you die there, that build is gone forever.</p>
