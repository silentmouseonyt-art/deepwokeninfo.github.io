        <p>If you need to know how many deaths you have before you get sent to the depths, look at your health bar. If it looks corroded that means you are 1 death away.</p>
        <p>If you want to make a build plan, you can use the deepwoken builder website.</p>
        <p>When you are a skilled player, you can progress in the depths. You get significantly more EXP, allowing a full build to be progged in less then an hour.</p>
        <p>Central Authority origin allows certain weapons to be used without their requirment.</p>
        <p>Equipment is very important, without good equipment you will not be able to compete.</p>
        <p>Never underestimate your opponent, PvE and PvP. The tables may turn very quickly.</p>
        <p>Shrines are very important for minmaxing your build, they use the currency "knowledge".</p>
        <p>To learn the basics of PvE, spamming trial of one will help.</p>
        <p>Certain boons and races give investment points on power up, these allow you to put points into stats without using their exp.</p>
